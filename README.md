Codes for Datasets 1,2 and 3.

For all Datasets & Synthetic Datasets 1,2 & 3, ensure the file path for the csv file is changed to whatever path it is in on your laptop/commputer.

Order to run code:

1. Run 'data_preprocessing.py' first to load and process the data
2. Run 'models_gan.py' to define the model
3. Run 'train_gan.py' to train and generate the synthetic dataset
4. Run 'cnn_data_preparation.py' to load and preprocess the data
5. Run 'models_cnn.py' to define the model
6. Run 'train_cnn.py' to start the training and see accuracy at the end
